# Simon (game)

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails the game is over.

I have tried creating a broswer version of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## How to play: 
1. When you start the game a color will be shown
2. You have to click on the shown color
3. If the shown color is clicked then the game will show you the next color to be click with the previous color
4. If you click on any color other than the shown color then the game over message will be shown

**Example**
There are 4 colors (green, red, yellow, and blue)
The game will show you one color to click say red. If you press red than the game show you the next color say green. Now you have to first press red and than click on green to maintian the sequence. Let say third color is yellow than you have to press red green and yellow.
